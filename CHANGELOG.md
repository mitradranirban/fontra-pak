**Changed**
- Migrated panel-color-graph from JavaScript to TypeScript.

- Added explicit class field declarations and typed constructor/method parameters.

- Introduced local types for paint-node options and schema descriptors.

- Merged changes from version 2026.5.1 of upstream Fontra


## [0.7.4] - 2026-05-25
### fontra-color-support

**Fixed**

**fix(color-layers): rewrite `_convertV0toV1` to correctly migrate COLRv0 to COLRv1**

- Fixed conversion bypassing `_writeV1Paint`, which caused `fontra.colrv1.referencedGlyphs` to never be populated via `collectReferencedGlyphs`, breaking downstream glyph reference tracking.
- Fixed `PaintGlyph.glyph` references using bare suffixes (e.g. `color.0`) instead of parent-namespaced names (e.g. `A.color.0`), which caused naming collisions and file names inconsistent with the Fontra layer naming convention.
- Fixed conversion never creating the standalone top-level glyphs that COLRv1 `PaintGlyph` nodes reference, leaving dangling references that failed at compile time.
- Fixed variable font support: all active masters are now iterated so each source's sibling layer geometry (`bold^color.0`, `light^color.0`, etc.) is copied into the new referenced glyph, enabling correct interpolation across the design space.
- Fixed V0 sibling layers (`default^color.0`, etc.) not being deleted after conversion, leaving orphaned data in the parent glyph.
- Fixed the stale root-level `colorv1` safety guard running inside the wrong conditional block, causing it to silently skip cle

## [0.7.3] - 2025-0519
### fontra-color-support
**Added**

**Palette selector** in Color Graph Panel which render the selected glyph's paint or layers in selected palette's color

**Fixed**

Fixed error when saving custom data (color palettes) in single-UFO projects by using defaultWriter instead of defaultReader in UFOBackend.putCustomData

## [0.7.2] - 2025-05-17
### fontra-color-support
**fix designspace backend** to keep default layer unmapped in layer-name lib

## [0.7.1] - 2025-05-15

### ColrPak Main
**fix: ensure read-only checkbox defaults to unselected***

- Added `type=bool` to `applicationSettings.value("openFontsInReadOnlyMode")` in ColrPakMain.py. This prevents PyQt from evaluating string values like "false" as truthy, ensuring the checkbox correctly defaults to an unchecked state.

### fontra-color-support
**fix(backend): move color palettes to component UFO libs**

- The designspace backend was improperly saving color palettes and layer
mappings into the .designspace lib. This commit intercepts both keys in
`putCustomData`, discarding the layer mapping (handled per-glyph) and
distributing the color palettes to the lib.plist of every source UFO.
`getCustomData` is updated to read the palettes from the default UFO.
- Prevents `colorLayers` and `colorLayerMapping` from remaining in the `.designspace` file by stripping all ufo2ft color keys in `putCustomData`.
- Updates `getCustomData` to proactively strip cached designspace color keys so they don't leak back into the Fontra UI on reload.


## [0.7.0] - 2025-05-13

### ✨ New Features
- **COLRv0 Support:** Complete implementation of COLRv0 glyph loading and saving fron `.ttf` and `otf` sources.
- **UFO Color Layer Mapping:** Added support for the `com.github.googlei18n.ufo2ft.colorLayerMapping` protocol. This ensures that color layers are correctly associated with palette indices when exporting to UFO, enabling a seamless roundtrip between OpenType and UFO formats.

- **Enhanced Color UI:**
    - Added a new WIP **Color Graph** editor component for advanced visual COLRv1 manipulation.
    - Added support for **ClipBoxes**, allowing users to define and edit bounding areas for color glyphs.
    - Added rendering support for COLR v0 layers in default palette color (Changing of palette functionality to be added later).

### 🛠 Improvements & Refactoring
- **Glyph Grid Optimization:** Internal color components (e.g., `.color.0` glyphs) are now hidden from the main glyph list to reduce clutter, while remaining fully accessible through the parent glyph's Layers panel.
- **Variable Font Instancing:** Improved the `VarStoreInstancer` logic to handle color-specific variations (deltas) in paints and clip boxes more accurately across different axis locations.
- **COLRv1 Architecture:** Consolidated the paint graph unbuilding logic to handle both `colrPaintGraphs` and `colrGlyphPaintEntries` through a unified processing pipeline.

### 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
- Added localized strings for several languages (including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, German, and Spanish) for new color-related UI elements:
    - `Color Graph`
    - `Clip Box`
    - `Transform Glyph`
    - `Add keyframe at current axis location`

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed a syntax error in `opentype.py` that caused initialization failures when loading fonts with specific COLR versions.
- Fixed an issue where the standard UFO layer naming convention (`color.n`) was not being correctly applied during glyph loading.
- Corrected a bug where CFF2 compatibility checks were not being applied to generated color layers.

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-05-06
### Fixed
**fontra-color-support**

fix(paint-tool): correct PaintTransform bounding box origin and eliminate fallback flash

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added direct on-canvas editing for COLRv1 transform paints, including PaintTranslate, PaintRotate, PaintScale, PaintSkew, and matrix-based PaintTransform.

- Added transform-aware handle rendering with dedicated visuals such as translate crosshairs, rotation arcs, scale arms, skew guides, and PaintTransform parallelograms.

- Added bounds-aware PaintTransform editing by fetching child glyph bounds and falling back to computed path bounds when needed.

### Changed
- Expanded the unified paint tool from gradient-only editing into a general COLRv1 editor that dispatches behavior by handle role instead of a narrower handle map.

- Updated cursor behavior so different handle types display context-specific cursors such as move, resize, alias, cell, and crosshair.

- Reworked drag handling to properly separate direct coordinate edits, angle edits, and custom transform commits (such as scale, skew, and matrix adjustments).

### Fixed
- Fixed PaintTransform handle placement so transform wrappers are treated as top-level paint nodes instead of incorrectly reading only layer.paint.

- Fixed transform-handle sizing by using actual child glyph bounds when available, with a safe fallback when bounds cannot be resolved.

- Fixed palette cycling to successfully read palette data from the active font controller path used by the scene model.

- Fixed highlight and live-preview updates so transformed handle movement is redrawn smoothly and consistently during drag operations.

**fontra-compile(color-support)**

- **handle decomposed PaintTransform nodes**
- Adds a helper to normalize decomposed transform properties (translateX, scaleX, rotation, etc.) into a standard 6-element affine matrix using `DecomposedTransform`. The fix is applied to both static paint generation and variable font merging.

### Internal
- Reorganized paint-tool role handling into distinct direct-role, angle-role, and custom-role dispatch maps for better maintainability.

- Added internal helper utilities for raw path-bound calculation and transform-matrix point application.

- Updated COLRv1 test glyph fixtures to exercise the new transform and skew workflows, adjusting metrics and outline coordinates accordingly.

## [v0.5.2] - 2026-04-26
### fontra-color-support
**featcolrv1 improve PaintComposite authoring in panel-color-layers.js**

- Fix sourcePaint/backdropPaint child mutation paths for composite params and glyphs
- Add nested PaintColrLayers editing inside PaintComposite children
- Add sublayer add/remove/reorder and transform editing for composite child layers
- Switch PaintComposite defaults to string compositeMode and seeded PaintColrLayers source
- Preserve current glyph when converting a layer to PaintComposite
- Replace composite mode text input with a dropdown using native select
- Replace read-only composite child PaintColrLayers info with inline editable controls

## [v0.5.1] - 2026-04-24
### Github Workflow

- Make Flatpak build and Homebrew tap update compulsory with each release


## [v0.5.0] - 2026-04-24
### fontra-color-support
### Added
- Add panel support for `PaintTransform`, `PaintComposite`, `PaintSkew`, and `PaintRotate` in the COLRv1 Color Layers UI.
- Add a right-click editor menu action `Add Paint` to insert paint references to other glyphs.

### Fixed
- Fix COLRv1 panel editing and backend write-path issues discovered while adding the new paint types.
- Fix referenced glyph tracking so paint graph edits correctly update dependent glyph references.
- Fix assorted editor, rendering, and integration bugs related to COLRv1 paint graph authoring.

## [v0.4.5] -2026-04-22
fix(builder): cu2qu conversion, name table, and OpenType feature compilation

Three significant fixes to the font compilation pipeline:

1. **Fix cubic-in-glyf browser rejection (OTS compatibility)**
   - Remove glyphDataFormat=1 assignment for cubic glyf outlines
     as glyph-1 support is not main stream in any app yet
   - Add cu2qu conversion inside buildTTGlyph() when cubic off-curve
     points (flagCubic) are detected in the default source
   - Conversion is performed across ALL sources in lockstep using
     Cu2QuPen to ensure identical point counts across masters
   - Rebuild gvar variation deltas from converted quadratic coordinates
     so outline variation is preserved correctly after conversion
   - Keeps glyphDataFormat=0 (quadratic TrueType), which is the only
     value accepted by browser OTS implementations today
   - OpenType 1.9 cubic-in-glyf (glyphDataFormat=1) is spec-valid but
     rejected by all current browsers; this fix ensures web-ready output

2. **Fix name table compiled from font source metadata**
   - Replace empty setupNameTable(dict()) with data read from
     font-data.json via the existing getFontData() method
   - Populates familyName, styleName, fullName, uniqueFontIdentifier,
     version, and psName from fontInfo fields in the Fontra source

3. **Add OpenType feature compilation (GSUB/GPOS)**
   - Read features.txt from the .fontra package root (Adobe .fea format)
   - Compile into GSUB and GPOS tables using fontTools feaLib
     (addOpenTypeFeatures) after the font is otherwise fully built
   - Supports all feature types: calt, kern, liga, mark, etc.
   - Failure is non-fatal: emits a warning and continues without features

4. **Fix duplicate function definitions (flake8 F811)**
   - Remove duplicate definitions of _normalizePaletteLabels and
     _palettesHaveLabels that were already defined earlier in the module
## [v0.4.4] - 2026-04-16
feat(colrv1): add CPAL palette names + fix variable paint compilation

### New Features

#### CPAL v1 Palette Names
- Add `org.colrpak.colorPaletteLabels` lib key to store per-palette
  name strings in the .fontra source
- Read palette labels in `buildFont` via `_normalizePaletteLabels()`
- Emit CPAL version 1 with `paletteLabels` and corresponding nameIDs
  in the name table when any palette has a label, using
  `fontTools.colorLib.builder.buildCPAL`
- Add `_palettesHaveLabels()` guard so static fonts without labels
  continue to emit CPAL version 0 unchanged

#### UI (panel-color-palette.js)
- Add per-palette name input field bound to
  `org.colrpak.colorPaletteLabels`
- Sync label edits back to font data on change

#### Translations (local-language-overrides.csv)
- Add i18n strings for palette name label, placeholder, notice,
  and entry count (singular/plural) in all 11 supported languages
- Retranslate all existing strings into correct column order

### Bug Fixes

#### COLRv1 variable font compilation (builder.py)
- Move `pb.varstorebuilder = OnlineVarStoreBuilder(...)` to before
  the colorGlyphs loop so `make_var_scalar` always has a valid store;
  previously a variable glyph encountered first would crash with
  `ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1`
- Fix `userSpaceLocs` construction to use only fvar axis tags known
  to `PythonBuilder.axes`, preventing bare axis name strings from
  leaking into `VariableScalar.add_value` as invalid location keys
- Reuse `glyphInfo.model` (already validated in `prepareGlyphs`)
  instead of constructing a second `VariationModel` from raw
  user-space locations, avoiding index mismatches between the model's
  `reverseMapping` and the locations list

## [v0.4.3] - 2026-04-16
### color-support
Add full COLRv1 round-trip support and fix variation handling

This major update enhances the OTF backend's ability to read compiled COLRv1
color fonts and seamlessly convert them into Fontra's native format, preserving
crucial data like clip boxes and exact master metrics for editing and exporting.

COLRv1 Structural & ClipBox Support
- Map all 32 COLRv1 paint formats into Fontra's native camelCase dictionaries
  via the new `_convertPaintGraphToFontra` recursive converter.
- Extract `ClipList` definitions from the `COLR` table during initialization.
- Recognize Format 2 (variable) `ClipBox` VarIndexBase definitions and correctly
  add them to the location discovery loop.
- Instantiate specific `ClipBox` coordinates per master layer and preserve them
  inside `layer.glyph.customData["fontra.colrv1.clipBox"]`.

Variation & Indexing Fixes
- Fix a critical discrepancy where `_collectVarIndicesFromPaint` was gathering raw
  variation indices without applying `varIndexMap`, causing locations to detach
  from instancer mapping.
- Add `NO_VARIATION_INDEX` `None` guards to axis mapping resolution.
- Extract and preserve the OpenType `VarStore` and `VarIndexMap` directly into
  `customData` for flawless variable font re-compilation.

General Glyph & Font Source Updates
- Support indexing and resolving `PaintColrLayers` when a base glyph maps to
  multiple color layers or nested elements.
- Fix tuple/list structure initialization when converting `avar` map segments.
- Add guards for variable composite glyphs missing `axisValuesVarIndex` or
  `transformVarIndex` in `VARC` table.
- Convert FontTools `ColorLine` and color palette values natively to RGBA format.

## [v0.4.2] - 2026-04-13
### ColrPak
- Remove fetch Latest Release Info in Linux platform as that is crashing in Flatpak environment.

### fontra-color-support
fix(colrv1): restore layer-nested data structure for compiler and tool compatibility

In commit eae66e7, the COLRv1 data path was simplified to write to the
root glyph's customData. This caused a structural mismatch:
1. The Paint Tool failed to render/manipulate handles because it targets
   the layer instance's customData.
2. The Fontra compiler failed to associate color paints with their
   respective geometric contours.

This change reverts the "simplification" and enforces the previous standard (nested under layers[id].glyph.customData).

Changes:
- panel-color-layers.js: Update _writeV1Paint to target layer-specific glyph.
- panel-color-layers.js: Fix _convertV0toV1 to nest paint graph within layers.
- panel-color-layers.js: Adjust _addLayer to maintain COLRv1 graph alignment.
- edit-tools-paint.js: Ensure getV1Paint/writeV1Paint prioritize layer-nested data.
- Cleanup: Added logic to delete accidental root-level 'colorv1' keys.

Fixes: Invisible paint handles and compiler rendering errors.
## [v0.4.1] - 2026-04-12
### fontra-color-support
- updated to upstream branch 2026.4.1

### Deployment:

- Automated Generation of Flatpak and Homebrew script on release
- Add back portable windows executable

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-04-07
### Colrpak Main
#### Fixed
**fix(export): block OTF export for .fontra sources with user-facing error**

COLRv1 fonts require TrueType (glyf) outlines — CFF2 (OTF) is incompatible
with COLR/CPAL tables per the OpenType spec. .fontra is Colr Pak's native
COLRv1 format and must always compile to TTF or WOFF2.

Previously, selecting OTF as the export format for a .fontra source would
silently pass the request to fontra_compile, which crashed deep in
fontTools with AssertionError: assert not self.isTTF.

- Changes in doExportAs():
  - Added early return with QMessageBox.warning() when sourceExt == ".fontra"
    and fileExtension == "otf", informing the user to use TTF or WOFF2
  - Removed "otf" from the isfontrattfotf tuple — .fontra → compile path
    now only triggers for "ttf" and "woff2"

Note: .ufo and .designspace sources exporting to OTF are unaffected —
COLRv0 with CFF outlines is valid per spec and fontmake handles it correctly.
This guard is intentionally scoped to .fontra sources only.

#### Added

Both **nsis setup exe** and **msi installer** for Windows Platform are now available

#### Changed
Modified **Version scheme** and **organisaion** in Pyinstaller Spec to avoid confusion with Upstream fontra

### fontra-compile (color-support)
#### Fixed
**fix(builder): force TTF mode for .fontra sources to prevent CFF2/COLR collision**

COLRv1 fonts require TrueType (glyf) outlines — the OpenType spec does not
permit CFF2 in a font with COLR/CPAL tables. When a .fontra source contained
cubic curves, buildCFF2 was being set to True by the caller, causing:

  1. FontBuilder to initialize with isTTF=False
  2. The COLRv1 paint path to run (correctly detecting color data)
  3. setupCFF2() to be called immediately after, triggering:
       assert not self.isTTF  →  AssertionError (fontTools/fontBuilder.py:576)

Two guards added in builder.py:

build() — early guard before prepareGlyphs():
  - Resets buildCFF2=False if colorV1RawCache is non-empty (COLRv1 data found)
  - Also resets buildCFF2=False if the backend path ends in .fontra, catching
    fonts where base glyphs have cubic curves but no colorv1 customData yet
    (e.g. a plain .notdef drawn with cubic curves makes colorV1RawCache empty,
    bypassing the cache-only check and leaving buildCFF2=True)
  - Uses getattr(reader, "path") / getattr(reader, "_path") consistent with
    the existing pattern in getCustomData() and getFontData()

buildFont() — final guard before FontBuilder is instantiated:
  - Checks glyphInfos[*].hasColorV1, which is the fully-resolved authoritative
    signal populated after prepareGlyphs() completes
  - Ensures isTTF=True is passed to FontBuilder regardless of how build() was
    entered (CLI, direct instantiation, future code paths)

cu2qu handles cubic→quadratic conversion transparently during glyf table
construction, so forcing TTF mode does not lose any outline fidelity.

Reproducer: open any .fontra font with cubic outlines → Export As → TTF
Previously: AssertionError crash in fontra_compile.__main__.main()
Now: compiles cleanly with correct glyf + COLR/CPAL tables

**fix(colrv1): correct PaintSweepGradient angle units in dataToPaint** — scale startAngle/endAngle by 360.0 to convert Fontra turn fractions (0–1) to degrees
expected by paintcompiler. Regression introduced when the same fix was applied to the mergenode variation path in v0.2.4 but missed the static dataToPaint path.

### fontra-color-support
#### Fixed
**fix(colrv1-renderer): correct PaintComposite color rendering**

    COLRv1 glyphs with PaintComposite nodes rendered with incorrect colors
    due to backdrop paint bleeding directly onto the main canvas context.

    Root cause: Canvas 2D globalCompositeOperation composites against
    existing canvas content, not against a local backdrop. PaintComposite
    requires isolated rendering per the COLRv1 spec.

    Fix: render backdrop and source into OffscreenCanvas buffers, apply
    composite mode between them, blit result to main canvas.

    fixes issue #2

    Tested with: knobs, ticket, boarding-pass emoji glyphs.

#### Added
 **feat(colrv1): implement async clip glyph rendering for COLRv1 canvas**

    - Read paint graph from customData["colorv1"] (new backend format)
    - Resolve self-referencing PaintGlyph clips from positionedGlyph directly
    - Use getGlyphInstance to fetch external clip glyphs asynchronously
    - Add module-level _resolvedPathCache to persist paths across render frames
    - Add _pendingGlyphs guard to prevent duplicate fetch requests
    - Move COLRv1 pre-fetch to positionedLines listener in scene-controller
    - Use loadGlyphs for bulk pre-fetching referenced component glyphs
    - Canvas now renders COLRv1 glyphs with correct colors and clipping

    Clip glyph transform/positioning and axis-aware instantiation are
    still to be addressed in a future release.

- Replace favicon.ico with ColrPak icon

### Started
- Github page activated - to show Readme as webpage
## [v0.2.6] - 2026-03-23
### Changed
refactor: simplify CompileFontMakeAction to invoke fontmake directly from source path
Remove intermediate UFO/designspace export step and helper functions
(addInstances, addGlyphOrder, addMinimalGaspTable, _fixColorLibKeys).
Instead, unwrap the backend chain to find the original source path and
pass it directly to fontmake_main.

## [v0.2.5] -2026-03-22
### Fixed
fix: execute fontra_compile natively to resolve PyInstaller PATH issues

Previously, `exportFontToPathCompile` used `subprocess.run(["fontra-compile"])`.
When packaged with PyInstaller, this caused the application to search the system
$PATH (e.g., ~/.local/bin) for the executable rather than using the bundled module,
causing the compilation to fail.

This replaces the subprocess call with a direct python import of the bundled
`fontra_compile.__main__.main` function. To maintain exact compatibility with
the existing UI log parser, this commit also:
- Mocks `sys.argv` and `os.chdir` to simulate the external command environment
- Captures stdout/stderr in memory using `io.StringIO`
- Catches `SystemExit` to accurately report the return code in the log file

## [v0.2.4] - 2026-03-21
### Fixed - fontra_compile@fontra-color-support
fix1: post hhea and os2 metrics not transmitted from fontra format font-info
 - Derive hhea and OS/2 metrics from shared source lineMetricsHorizontalLayout and customData instead of letting fontTools default to zeros

 - Set italicAngle, underline position/thickness, and isFixedPitch for the post table from top-level fontInfo
 - fix2: correct PaintSweepGradient angle variations and missing keys
- Handle missing `startAngle` and `endAngle` keys in Fontra JSON by
  providing a 0.0 fallback, preventing silent failures when defaults
  are omitted.
- Scale angles by 360.0 during `_merge_node` to convert Fontra's turn
  fractions (0-1) into the degrees expected by fontTools/paintcompiler.
  This fixes the issue where variation deltas in the VarStore were
  calculated with the wrong magnitude.
## [v0.2.3] - 2026-03-20
### Fixed - fontra-color-support
fix(colrv1): correct PaintLinearGradient P2 projection, radial transform, and sweep gradient arc

Three bugs in the COLRv1 canvas renderer caused gradient paints to render
incorrectly relative to what the font specifies.

--- PaintLinearGradient ---

Canvas 2D createLinearGradient takes two points, but COLRv1 defines three:
P0 (start), P1 (end), and P2 (rotation anchor). The renderer was passing
P0→P1 directly and ignoring P2, producing wrong or reversed gradient axes.

Fix: project P1 onto the perpendicular of (P2−P0) to derive the correct
effective end point P1eff before calling createLinearGradient. When P2
coincides with P0 (degenerate case) fall back to P1 unchanged.

--- PaintRadialGradient ---

COLRv1 radial gradients support an affine transform on the gradient cone,
allowing elliptical or rotated radials. The renderer silently discarded
paint.transform, so any non-circular radial gradient rendered as a plain
symmetric cone.

Fix: wrap the paint in ctx.save()/ctx.restore() and apply paint.transform
via ctx.transform() before calling createRadialGradient, so the cone is
correctly skewed/rotated by the context matrix.

--- PaintSweepGradient ---

Three separate errors:

1. endAngle ignored — createConicGradient was called with only startAngle;
   endAngle was never read. Partial arc sweeps always filled the full 360°.

2. Wrong sweep direction — COLRv1 sweep angles are counter-clockwise (font
   Y-up). Canvas 2D createConicGradient is clockwise (Y-down). The scene
   transform already flips Y, so the angle must be negated to preserve the
   correct sweep direction. Without this, all sweeps were mirrored.

3. Color stops not remapped to arc — stops are defined by the font author
   relative to the [startAngle, endAngle] arc (0→1 across that arc), but
   were being passed directly to the conic gradient which interprets them
   relative to a full 360° turn. Fix: scale each stop offset by
   arcSpan / (2π) before calling _applyColorLine.

Previews color v1 paint actually what is going to shipped in final font
## [v0.2.2] - 2026-03-19
**fontra_compile fix** : COLRv1 multi-source variation VarStore population

- Correct _merge_scalar to return proper {location: value} dicts for paintcompiler
- Build normalized VariationModel for paint merging (not glyph outline model)
- Key format ((tag, loc),) so dict(key) → {tag: loc} works correctly
- paintcompiler.make_var_scalar now receives absolute values at normalized locations
- Produces Format=5 PaintVarLinearGradient + populated VarStore.RegionCount=1
- pass userSpaceLocs to merge_paint_sources to fix VariationModel crash on fontTools ≥ 4.62.1

Exports working variable COLR TTF.

## [v0.2.1] — 2026-03-18
### Fixed

- **COLRv1 variable font compilation failure** — ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fontra_compile' at runtime caused by PyInstaller silently dropping fontra_compile.builder from the bundle
- **Root cause**  — fontTools.ttLib.tables.otConverters has a circular dependency on otTables; when PyInstaller imported otConverters in isolation during static analysis the partial initialisation failure caused the entire fontra_compile package to be excluded
- Fix 1 — Added pre-import of fontTools.ttLib.tables.otTables before otConverters at the top of FontraPak.spec to resolve the circular import before analysis begins
- Fix 2 — Added fontTools, fontmake, ufo2ft to modules_to_collect_all so the full module graph is resolved before fontra_compile is analysed
- Fix 3 — Added fontra_compile.builder and key fontTools.ttLib submodules explicitly to hiddenimports as a secondary safeguard

### Verified

COLRv1 variable font compiles and renders correctly with colour palette and variable axes intact

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-03-18

### Colr Pak (`mitradranirban/colr-pak`)

#### Features
- Add on-screen **Paint Tool** (`edit-tools-paint`) for interactive COLRv1 editing:
  - Drag-to-reposition handles for linear, radial, and sweep gradients
  - Click-to-cycle `paletteIndex` for `PaintSolid` layers
  - Dynamic cursor updates based on handle role under pointer
  - Visualization layer drawing handle circles, diamond badges, and dashed connector lines between gradient control points
- Rename app menu title from `Fontra Pak` to `Colr Pak` in `fontra-menus`
- Add separator between palette number and number of entries in the color palette panel

#### Bug Fixes
- Fix import path in `colr.py` — use absolute instead of relative imports

---

### Fontra (`mitradranirban/fontra`, branch `fontra-color-support`)

#### Features
- Rebased to upstream Fontra `2026.3.4`

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix "add stop" button for COLRv1 gradients — fix method name references (`_setV1ArrayField`, `_writeV1Paint`) and correct `colorStops` nesting structure
- Fix TTF COLRv1 paint loading, panel detection, and rendering

---

### fontra-compile (`mitradranirban/fontra-compile` branch `fontra-color-support` )

#### Bug Fixes
- Fix `copyFont` stripping color palette data from temporary UFO before compiling through fontmake, which caused color variable fonts to export as monochrome
- Add function to prevent stripping of color palette data from `lib.plist` in variable font compilation

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-03-16

colr-pak 0.1.3
Bugfix: Removed `drop-unreachable-glyphs` from the export workflow and `drop-unused-sources-and-layers` from the fontmake compile action in fontra-compile — both filters were silently stripping color layer glyphs before fontmake could build the COLR/CPAL tables, resulting in monochrome output.
## [v0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Colr Pak (`mitradranirban/colr-pak`)

#### Bug Fixes
- Fix export of `.fontra` to `.ttf`/`.otf` via `fontra-compile` — resolves
  `TypeError: run_original() takes 0 positional arguments but 4 were given`
  crash when exporting from a loaded TTF font

#### Refactor
- Refactor `doExportAs` to use top-level `exportFontToPath` and new
  `exportFontToPathCompile` functions as multiprocessing targets, matching
  upstream Fontra Pak structure and preventing future breakage
- Add `COLR_PAK_VERSION` constant for single-point version management

### Fontra (`mitradranirban/fontra`, branch `fontra-color-support`)

#### Bug Fixes
- `fix(colrv1)`: Restore `paletteIndex` in gradient `colorStops` —
  `_convertColorLine` was reading `stop.Color?.PaletteIndex` but raw
  fontTools stores `PaletteIndex` directly on the stop object; all gradient
  palette indexes were defaulting to 0
- `fix(colrv1)`: Fix "add stop" button for COLRv1 gradients — fix method
  name references (`_setV1ArrayField`, `_writeV1Paint`) and correct
  `colorStops` nesting structure
- `fix(colrv1)`: TTF COLRv1 paint loading, panel detection and rendering —

- Remove accidental `.bak` file from bisect
- Rebased to current fontra `release/0.2.0`

### fontra-compile (`mitradranirban/fontra-compile`)

#### Features
- `feat`: Add COLRv1 compile support via `PythonBuilder` — reads paint data
  and palettes directly from `font-data.json`/glyph JSON; implements full
  `_dataToPaint()` covering solid, gradients, transforms, composite, with
  `varscalar()` for Fontra keyframe variation specs

#### Removals
- Remove deprecated `compile_colorv1_action.py` entry point — COLRv1
  compilation now handled entirely in `build.py`

---

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Colr Pak
- Remove deprecated `colorV1_export_helper` from fontra-compile integration
- Redirect `.fontra` files exclusively to `fontra-compile` for proper
  COLR and CPAL table compilation
- Rebase to fontra `2026.3.2`


#### Maintenance
- Add missing translations (i18n strings for new color UI)
- Add test font for COLRv1 testing
#### Fixes
 add `convertPaintGraph`/`convertColorLine` for fontTools raw format
  conversion; fix COLRv0 TTF panel detection
- `fix`: Add color palette support for UFO backend
